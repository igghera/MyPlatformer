MyPlatformer
============

A simple platform game written in haXe to try out some of the amazing feature of the NME framework.
The game has been built following this tutorial <a href='http://dustytome.net/moot/2012/10/haxe-flixel-bullets-parallax-and-health/'>here</a> and makes use of the great Flixel game framework.

It builds successfully for Android and iOS targets.

The main goal is to start from here and integrate a physics engine like box2d, also available as a haxe lib.
